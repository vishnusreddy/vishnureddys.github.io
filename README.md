## Hi :wave:
I'm Vishnu. I'm a senior at PES University doing my undergrad in computer science with a specialization in machine intelligence and data science. 
I've gained considerable experience in MIDS by working on multiple projects in data analytics, data science, machine learning, deep learning and big data.  

Apart from this, I also build high quality cross-platform mobile applications and responsive web apps with the latest tools and frameworks. 
With my internships at **InDemys Analytics** and **Kavach Networks**, I learnt the best practices to write production-ready code for all projects.

I love content writing and for this reason, started [hello ML](https://helloml.org) with a few friends from PES to cater to the developer community. 
Mentored over 150 students over a span of 10 months and grew to over 100,000 readers per month.  

Currently, I'm working on building a real-time proctoring system that aids human proctors to conduct remote exams by leveraging the concepts of computer vision and machine learning.

I'm looking for internships in software development (preferably remote). If you know any openings and think I'm a good fit, do reach out to me.
